# Iris dataset classification
This is actually a small and easy dataset to play with. In this repo, I've experiemented with some basic Machine Learning algorithms to see which ones perform the best on this dataset. I implemented these algorithms by hand in order to understand how they work, as well as by using built-in libraries.
